# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

_Versioning: this repo is versioned as a single unit — one tag per release,
covering both frontend and backend together. `backend/pyproject.toml` and
`frontend/package.json` version fields are bumped to match on release, not
tracked independently._

## [0.1.5] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- A Frameworks and Tools record, and the real iEDI stack on the experience
  record it was missing from.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- Long unbroken text no longer overflows the message bubble.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- The chat window is no longer overlapped by the mobile browser's URL bar.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-12

### Security

- The system prompt is now added backend-side only and stripped from both the
  JSON and streaming chat responses, so it is no longer part of the history
  returned to clients. A `system` message present in an incoming request is
  dropped rather than forwarded to the model.
- The non-streaming chat path now bounds tool-call rounds with
  `MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS`, shared with the streaming path, instead of looping without
  an upper limit.

### Fixed

- Streaming `done` event repeated the assistant reply: the message was appended
  once by the streaming loop and again when building the final history.
